- Add Name, Short Name, Packed Name options to SKU's
  - Have defaults if not set
- OpenGL/ES 1 and OpenGL/ES 2 in a single code path merge!
- Premake setup (i.e. MSVC and Xcode)
  - Update to generate premake lua script based on the SKU and platform data
  - place the msvc project in to obj folder, and write exe to output
  - do xcode generator
- Airplay setup (iOS, Android, etc)

- standard packaging method that creates a folder and copies all files in to
  - Then per platform code can be run on the package folder, such as palm and linux
  - should be generic enough to use for android (i.e. copy in to target)
- ??


Completed **

- content.sh -- New tool in root for checking out
- ".repos" -- New file containing the repository root (default svn://192.168.0.101/legends/)
- Add source tree
- New Game Folders -- GameBlah
  - Rename Game to Smiles, GameSmiles, or SmilesGame (something distinct)
  - Add Legends, GameLegends, or LegendsGame folder (see above)
- Smiles and Legends will require separate root folders (d:/Smiles and d:/Legends)
  - Experiments needs some way to co-exist
    - GameExperiments (code and content), then some plugable code area for distinct tests
- Will need some good way of differentiating/collecting project files generate/stored per proj.
  - Smiles has multiple projects, as will other games.
- New Experiments Tree
  - Should be easy to add a new dummy app
    - Template!
- Move Custom to SKU folder, no more weird share system!
