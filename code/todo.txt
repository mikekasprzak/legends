
TODO List for 2011 GEL and Foundation Project "Legends" Tree Restructure

- Add source tree
- New Game Folders -- GameBlah
  - Rename Game to Smiles, GameSmiles, or SmilesGame (something distinct)
  - Add Legends, GameLegends, or LegendsGame folder (see above)
- New Experiments Tree
  - Should be easy to add a new dummy app
    - Template!
- content.sh -- New tool in root for checking out
- ".repos" -- New file containing the repository root (default svn://192.168.0.101/legends/)
- standard packaging method that creates a folder and copies all files in to
  - Then per platform code can be run on the package folder, such as palm and linux
- Smiles and Legends will require separate root folders (d:/Smiles and d:/Legends)
  - Experiments needs some way to co-exist
    - GameExperiments (code and content), then some plugable code area for distinct tests
- ??
