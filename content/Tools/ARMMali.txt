
The ARM Mali Texture Tool Generates several image files when mipmaps are enabled.

So, TODO: create a tool that takes several of the ETC1 files and converts them
to a PVR file.

Also, make it support a single image. Notably, the single image option generates
a different filename (no _mip_0).
