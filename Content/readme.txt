This folder (Content) is special.

It has an SVN ignore on it, so no files will be detected as changed (except this)

It is populated per-project by the content.sh shell script. Specific subfolders
must be updated and comitted manually.  Art, Sound and Music belong to specific
projects, while Tools is shared across all projects.
